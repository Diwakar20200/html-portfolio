<h1>The Best Movies According to Diwakar</h1>
<h2>My top 3 KH movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Mahanadhi</h3>
<h4><p>I would always point to this underrated classic</p></h4>
<hr />
<h3>'Hey Ram'</h3>
<h4><p>It is highly difficult to single out a movie from this 
    encyclopedia of cinema! There are numerous great 
    masterpieces... But I gained a lot of respect for Kamal 
    after watching this epic movie.
